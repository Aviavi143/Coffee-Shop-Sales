Welcome to the Coffee Shop Sales Analysis project! This repository contains an Excel-based analysis of sales data from a fictional coffee shop. The project aims to provide insights into various aspects of the coffee shop's performance using Excel's powerful tools for data manipulation and visualization.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
The project begins with data cleaning and preparation steps to ensure the data is structured and ready for analysis. This includes tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Using Excel's pivot tables, charts, and functions, we perform EDA to understand sales trends over time, popular products, customer demographics, and more. This analysis helps in identifying patterns and areas for improvement.

The project includes various visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to present the findings in a clear and intuitive manner. Visualizations make it easier to grasp trends and patterns at a glance.
Customer Segmentation:
Using Excel's functionalities, we segment customers based on their buying behavior, loyalty, and demographics. This segmentation can guide targeted marketing strategies.
Forecasting:
Utilizing Excel's forecasting tools, we attempt to predict future sales based on historical data. This helps in planning inventory and staffing requirements.
